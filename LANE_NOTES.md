# Lane notes

Append-only handoff log between lanes and the integrator (docs/ops/AGENT_RUNBOOK.md).
Format: `## <date> · <lane> · <branch>`, then **Done**, **Requests for other paths**, **Open issues**.

## 2026-09-23 · Step 0 bootstrap · v3

**Done**
- v2 app moved to `legacy/`. v3 skeletons in `backend/` and `frontend/`; `Makefile`; `make fixtures` (13/13 QC codes, deterministic); `make check` green.
- Toolchain: Python 3.12 (uv venv at `backend/.venv`), Node native locally (RUNTIME=native).

**Open issues for later lanes**
- P1: `pyradiomics` is in the optional `[radiomics]` extra until the Python 3.12 spike passes (ADR-0006). Not installed by `make setup`.
- P1: Starlette warns that the TestClient's `httpx` backend is deprecated in favour of `httpx2`; revisit when adding API tests.
- Frontend pins: TypeScript ~5.9 (openapi-typescript and typescript-eslint reject 6+/7) and ESLint 9 (eslint-plugin-react rejects 10). Revisit when upstream supports them.
- `fingerprint_changed` fixture needs a test step: index, then modify `expected.json → mutate_after_index`, then revalidate.
- Extra warnings are expected alongside a defect's main code (e.g. `missing_seg` on the `unreadable_file` case); tests should assert inclusion, not exact sets.

## 2026-09-23 · P0.5 design · lane/1-design

**Done**
- `frontend/`: tokens (GitHub Dark + Light), base styles, CT icon set (UI-15), registry-driven shell (UI-01/02) on dockview, command palette / quick open, keybindings with overrides, status bar, toasts, reviewer prompt.
- Features on a mock API seeded from `make fixtures` (`npm run mock:seed`, seed committed ~0.9 MB): home, import wizard, project view with thumbnails, 2×2 viewer placeholder (real mid-slices, VW-04 colours), curation + history + correction queue, radiomics settings (schema-driven, live validation), run dashboard (ECharts, lazy), measurements, jobs/output.
- Tests: i18n key coverage, CUR-08 rollup, RAD-04 rules, dashboard analytics, chords, icon rules. `make check` green.
- UI_SHELL.md updated (Alt+W close tab, Image view + section, CT icon list, theme choice, prototype defaults).

**Requests for other paths**
- ROADMAP.md (integrator): mark P0.5 tasks done except the curator/researcher walkthrough.
- Deps added: react-router 7, zustand, @tanstack/react-query + react-virtual, dockview-react, radix (dialog, dropdown-menu, tooltip, checkbox), @vscode/codicons, cmdk, echarts.

**Open issues**
- Port 5173 is held by VS Code on the dev Mac; the lane dev server ran on 5174.
- P2: replace `api/mock` with the generated client behind the same `api` surface; dashboard sub-panels (DB-01) and brushing (DB-04) are not in the prototype.
